# Eat-Da-Burger

    
## Description
    
This fun application allows users to digitally devour delicous burgers!

Hungry folks can make a burger by entering their burg's name at the bottom. Once submitted, the burger is added to the receipt and is available to be devoured. Just click the "Devour!" button, and it'll move the burger to the Devoured Burgers receipt.

This application uses a MySQL database to store the burgers entered by the user and keep track of which have been devoured and which are still available. Handlebars is also used, along with MVC.
